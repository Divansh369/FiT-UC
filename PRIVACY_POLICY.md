*   **Red Alert Report Data:** If you submit a Red Alert report, we collect information such as the description of the emergency, your location (if you choose to provide it), your name and contact details (if you choose not to report anonymously), and any attached photos, audio recordings, or files. This data is used solely for the purpose of addressing the reported emergency.

All data collected is stored securely on our backend servers (NocoDB) and, where applicable, temporarily or persistently on your device for offline access and functionality.

We do not include any third-party analytics software that collects personally identifiable information.
